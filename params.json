{"name":"Dewitt Buckingham","tagline":"I use cool things to make cool things","body":"# Howdy, I'm Dewitt\r\n\r\n## I'm a web developer and designer. \r\n\r\nI have some formal education in software engineering but beyond that I am mostly self-taught. I've been playing around with websites since age 15 and software in general since way before that. I like to stay up-to-date on current web technologies and stanards. I'm constantly learning new ways of not only building sites and apps but improving on existing ones. Basically, I use cool things to make cool things.\r\n\r\nWhile I'm a programmer at heart, I've heavily ventured into front-end design. Responsive and clean interfaces are what I strive for with my designs while my work on the back-end is geared towards performance and maintainability. Overall, I aim for simple and elegant solutions across the full stack.\r\n\r\n**I am currently for hire for small- to medium-sized website and web app projects.**\r\n\r\nIf you would like to contact me, please feel free to [shoot me an email](mailto:captain@zerodaedalus.net). You can also [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ZeroDaedalus). I also  [accept PayPal donations](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=AYVA292HL7LL6).\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\nHere are some of the cool things that I use:  \r\n* Pen and Paper\r\n* Linux\r\n* Node/npm\r\n* jQuery\r\n* Bootstrap\r\n* Grunt\r\n* Sass\r\n* Jade\r\n* Git\r\n* WordPress\r\n\r\nTechnologies that I regularly work with:  \r\n* HTML + CSS\r\n* JavaScript\r\n* PHP\r\n* Bash/Shell Scripts\r\n* MySQL\r\n* NoSQL (MongoDB)\r\n* Apache\r\n* Nginx\r\n\r\n# Projects\r\n### [IFB](//staging.zerodaedalus.com/ifb) &bull; [Repo](//github.com/dajoker29/food-bank-site)\r\n\r\nThe Interfaith Food Bank is an awesome non-profit organization in Stockton, California which provides other non-profits (such as churches, group homes, etc.) with foodstuffs and other supplies to be dispensed to the public. As a gift for their dedicated work in providing for the community, I designed a website to help them spread their message and allow them to easily accept more donations.","google":"UA-48886757-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
