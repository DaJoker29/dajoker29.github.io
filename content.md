# Background

I have some formal education in software engineering but beyond that I am mostly self-taught. I've been playing around with websites since age 15 and software in general since way before that. I like to stay up-to-date on current web technologies and stanards. I'm constantly learning new ways of not only building sites and apps but improving on existing ones.

While I'm a programmer at heart, I've heavily ventured into front-end design. Responsive and clean interfaces are what I strive for with my designs while my work on the back-end is geared towards performance and maintainability. Overall, I aim for simple and elegant solutions across the full stack.

Server configuration and management. Implementation of popular CMSes and MVC frameworks. Web accessability standards. Content and Copy Editing.

# Projects

### IFB
The Interfaith Food Bank is an awesome non-profit organization in Stockton, California which provides other non-profits (such as churches, group homes, etc.) with foodstuffs and other supplies to be dispensed to the public. As a gift for their dedicated work in providing for the community, I designed a website to help them spread their message and allow them to easily accept more donations.

### Theta
Theta is a minimal WordPress theme built to give sites a sleek, sophisticated appeal while not distracting from the site's main content. It will eventually be released as a free theme on WordPress.org.
